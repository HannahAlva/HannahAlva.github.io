    <p>Hello, my name is Hannah! I am a senior and this is the last class I need to graduate! I am a psychology major with a minor in computer science. I love learning about psychology, and was very interested in learning something completly
      different. I was hoping to take a gap year to travel and look into graduate school programs, and although that is going to look very different than what I had intended I am excited to devote more time to learning everything I can!</p>
