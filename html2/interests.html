  <p>All of these images are interesting to me because this past semester was my last full term here at CSUF and I am so grateful for the people I have gotten to love along the way! I will always be especially thankful to have had such great roomates
    these past few years. House 203 has been an amazing home thanks to some wonderful people: </p>
