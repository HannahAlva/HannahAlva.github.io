    <p>Hello, my name is Hannah! I am a senior and this is the last class I need to graduate! I am a psychology major with a minor in computer science. I love learning about psychology, and was very interested in learning something completly
      different. I was hoping to take a gap year to travel and look into graduate school programs, and although that is going to look very different than what I had intended I am excited to devote more time to learning everything I can!</p>
    <p>I am learning to change the color backrounds for alternating paragraphs!</p>
    <p>I have made some extra paragraphs to see this well.</p>
    <p>It is insane to think this class is just about halfway through, and how quickly one is able to learn so much!</p>
